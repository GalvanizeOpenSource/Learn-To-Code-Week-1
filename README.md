# Learn-To-Code-Week-1

## Overview
Our goal this week is to setup our developer environment and link it to our github account for
maximum developer points. We'll also download the Atom text editor and do a little
bit of coding.


Here's what we'll be doing:

#### Overview of basic HTML concepts
#### Overview of CSS concepts
#### Signing up for github and learning about git
#### Forking and cloning our first project
#### Editing HTML/CSS and pushing code back up to Github.


## Overview of HTML
- tags
- elements
- attributes

####HTML tags:
Tags are used to mark up the beginning and end of an HTML element.

```html
<div></div>
```

####HTML elements:
An element in HTML represents some kind of structure, generally and element
consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

  ```html
  <p>This is an element, it consists of p tags and content.</p>
  ```

####HTML attributes:
HTML attributes generally appear as name-value pairs. The most common attributes
are
- id "id is used on only a single element"
- class  "class can be used on multiple elements"
- src "provides the location of an asset that element needs"
- href "specifies a link destination"



## Overview of CSS
- Specificity
- id's vs Classes
- syntax

####Specificity
What Does CSS Stand for?


####id's vs Classes
Classes are used when you need to style multiple elemnets in a document, while
id's are used to style specific elements on a page.

####Syntax
Lets look at how to style an element!

```html
<p class="coolThings">Cool Things</p>
```
Now lets look at the css!
```css
.coolThings {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```




## What is git?
Git is a piece of software that allows you to edit and collaborate on projects
regardless of your teams location. With Git, you and your team can all be working
on the same codebase without having to worry about who's doing what in which order.
